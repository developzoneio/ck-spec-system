# /sd:verify - traceability verification gate

Pure verification command - no subagent, no code changes, no edits outside the spec's own
folder. Proves that every success criterion and scenario in `00-spec.md` is implemented by at
least one task in `02-tasks.md` and observable through at least one existing test, then runs
the project test suite and writes `<spec.dir>/<ID>/06-verify.md` recording the verdict.

The spec-gate hook blocks an `index.md` row transitioning to `done` unless this artifact
records `result: pass`. Re-run the command after fixing findings; it overwrites the artifact.

## State machine

| Condition | State | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Spec folder missing | not-found | STOP with VF001 |
| `02-tasks.md` missing | not-planned | STOP with VF002 |
| Otherwise | verifiable | Run all applicable checks, write artifact |

Any status may be verified (verification before `in-progress` is allowed and useful), but the
artifact only matters to the hook at the `in-progress -> done` transition.

## Phase 0 - Bootstrap (always)

1. Read `.claude/project-config.json` -> `spec.dir`, `spec.indexFile`, `commands.test`.
   Missing config -> STOP: "No project config found - run /sd:setup first."
2. Resolve `<arg>` against `<spec.dir>/`: accept a full ID (`FEAT-1042`) or unique suffix.
   Ambiguous or missing -> STOP listing candidates.
3. Read from disk (commands cannot load skills via frontmatter):
   - `~/.claude/skills/sd/sd-severity-taxonomy/SKILL.md`
   - `~/.claude/skills/sd/sd-evidence-citation/SKILL.md`

## Checks

Stable rule IDs (report every finding as `VF0xx`, severity per sd-severity-taxonomy, citing
`file:line` relative to project root). Generic rules apply to all spec types; traceability
rules apply when the corresponding section exists in `00-spec.md`.

| ID | Applies | Check | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| VF001 | all | Spec folder and `00-spec.md` exist | BLOCK |
| VF002 | all | `02-tasks.md` exists | BLOCK |
| VF003 | all | Spec frontmatter `id` matches the folder name | BLOCK |
| VF010 | spec has `SC-<n>:` scenario headings | Every SC ID is listed in >=1 task's `Covers` | BLOCK |
| VF011 | spec has `AC-<n>:` criteria | Every AC ID is listed in >=1 task's `Covers` | BLOCK |
| VF012 | tasks have `Covers` | Every ID referenced in a `Covers` exists in `00-spec.md` | BLOCK |
| VF013 | feature specs | `## Success criteria` checkboxes carry `AC-<n>:` prefixes | WARN |
| VF020 | all | Every task whose `Covers` != none has a `Test` field that is not `none`/empty | BLOCK |
| VF021 | all | Every file path named in a `Test` field exists (use Glob; a `Test` naming a suite/pattern instead of a path is checked by VF022 only) | BLOCK |
| VF022 | all | `commands.test` from project-config runs and exits green | BLOCK |
| VF023 | `commands.test` empty/null | Cannot run tests - report and continue | WARN |
| VF030 | all | Every `## Success criteria` checkbox in `00-spec.md` is checked (`- [x]`) | BLOCK |

Parsing shapes (exact):

- Scenario IDs: headings matching `^### SC-([0-9]+):` in `00-spec.md`.
- Criterion IDs: lines matching `^- \[[ xX]\] AC-([0-9]+):` in `00-spec.md`.
- Covers: task lines matching `^- \*\*Covers\*\*: (.+)$` in `02-tasks.md`; split on commas;
  `none` means no IDs. A task block with no `Covers` line is treated as `Covers: none`
  (legacy compatibility).
- Test files: from each `- **Test**: ...` value, extract tokens that look like relative paths
  (contain `/` or a file extension); check each with Glob.

VF022 execution: run `commands.test` via Bash from the project root. Capture the exit code.
Do not guess a test command when `commands.test` is empty - that is VF023 (stack-agnostic
<!-- contract-lint: allow CL400 - these are FORBIDDEN examples illustrating the stack-agnostic rule itself, not a hardcoded command this file runs -->
rule: never hardcode `dotnet test`, `npm test`, etc.).

## Artifact

ALWAYS write `<spec.dir>/<ID>/06-verify.md` (overwrite an existing one) - on pass AND on fail -
once the spec reaches the `verifiable` state. The `not-found` (VF001) and `not-planned` (VF002)
STOP states above are reached BEFORE that point and write no artifact at all: there is no spec
folder, or no `02-tasks.md` to check traceability against, so there is nothing yet to record.

```markdown

# Verification report - <ID>

## Traceability

| ID | Kind | Covered by | Test(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-1 | scenario | T01, T03 | tests/... | PASS |
| AC-1 | criterion | T02 | tests/... | PASS |

## Test run

- Command: `<commands.test or "not configured (VF023)">`
- Exit code: <n or "-">

## Findings

<severity-tagged VF0xx findings with file:line citations, or "none">
```

`result: pass` if and only if there are zero BLOCK-severity findings. WARN findings (VF013,
VF023) do not fail the run but must appear under Findings.

## Output

Print to the user: the traceability table, the findings list, the artifact path, and one of:

- `[OK] <ID> verified - result: pass recorded in <spec.dir>/<ID>/06-verify.md`
- `[FAIL] <ID> verification failed (<n> BLOCK findings) - result: fail recorded. Close-out is
  blocked until /sd:verify passes.`

## Hard constraints

- Never edit any file except `<spec.dir>/<ID>/06-verify.md`.
- Never invoke a subagent.
- Never mark a criterion covered without a concrete task ID + existing test citation.
- Findings without a `file:line` citation are invalid (sd-evidence-citation).
